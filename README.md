# BooFuzz Lab
This lab was produced for CSE548 Project 4 to demonstrate the use of the 
open-source fuzzer and tool [BooFuzz](https://github.com/jtpereyda/boofuzz) 

## Tutorial
In this repo we have an example of using BooFuzz to rediscover a critical 
bug in Netflix'x DIAL Server. The tutorial code can be found in the 
`examples/netflix-dial-http-server/` folder. The Tutorial uses Docker and 
Docker Compose to run the lab.

Please see the [README.md](./examples/netflix-dial-http-server/README.md) in the netflix dial example.
